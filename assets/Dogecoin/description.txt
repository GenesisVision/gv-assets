Name:
Dogecoin

Symbol:
DOGE

Description:
A Bitcoin clone that has reached success through clever marketing. Dogecoin has sponsored multiple high profile events such as Nascar teams and the winter Olympics - even so, there are few locations to use the coin - and instead, it has become a de facto internet tipping currency. The coin has produced 100 billion units by the end of 469716 and is now producing roughly 5 billion units per year.
