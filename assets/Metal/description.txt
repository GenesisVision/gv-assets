Description:
Metal is a blockchain-based system utilizing Proof-of-Processed-Payments to identify users, rewarding them for converting legacy fiat currency into cryptocurrency. It is a system similar to bitcoin but with a user-friendly interface and front-end that is similar to Venmo, Square or PayPal. Metal can act as a bridge to bitcoin or any cryptocurrency available. Metal believes cash only businesses can benefit by adopting cryptocurrency as a new new form of cash, as cryptocurrencies possess many of the same properties particularly around privacy, censorship resistance and fungibility. In order to bring digital payments into a world that utilizes blockchain-based technology over some traditional banking rails, Metal expects to save consumers 4-5% on all purchases.
