Chainlink

LINK

Description:
Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized network that provides information (oracles) to smart contracts. Smart contracts are designed to execute automatically when certain paramenters are met, however, when these parameters exist off-chain there is a reliance on sources of information (known as oracles) to provide the necessary information. ChainLink aims to break this reliance by feeding information to smart contracts via a network of decentralized oracles. The ChainLink network allows users who have either a data feed or information carrying APIs to easily provide information to smart-contracts in exchange for the LINK token.
