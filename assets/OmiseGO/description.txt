Description:
OmiseGO is building a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. This high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from at-backed issuers to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and native cryptocurrencies). Unlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms, this allows for the decentralized exchange of other blockchains and between multiple blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token.
