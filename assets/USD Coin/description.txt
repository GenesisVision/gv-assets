Description:
USD Coin (USDC) is a fully collateralized US Dollar stablecoin based on the open source fiat stablecoin framework developed by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Customers from around the world can tokenize US Dollars into USDC and / or redeem USDC back into US Dollars with Circle and Coinbase. USDC tokens are ERC-20 compatible and can be used with any ERC-20 compatible digital wallet or service. USDC is fully collateralized - every unit of USDC is only ever issued after a corresponding US Dollar is deposited in reserve bank accounts.
