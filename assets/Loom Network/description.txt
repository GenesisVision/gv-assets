Description:
Loom Network is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is a network of Delegated Proof of Stake (“DPoS”) sidechains, allowing for highly-scalable games and user-facing dApps while still being backed by the security of Ethereum. The fundamental building block of Loom Network is an SDK that allows developers to quickly build their own blockchains without having to understand blockchain infrastructure — a "build your own blockchain" generator.
