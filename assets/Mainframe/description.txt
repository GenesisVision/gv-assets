Description:
The MFT (Mainframe) ERC-20 token can be used as a medium of exchange within it's platform. The Mainframe Lending Protocol allows anyone to borrow against their crypto by leveraging collateral assets approved by Mainframe Governance. Mainframe uses a bond-like instrument, representing an on-chain obligation that settles on a specific future date. Buying and selling the tokenized debt enables fixed-rate lending and borrowing ï¿½ something much needed in decentralized finance today. Mainframe Governance is the community organized process of managing the various aspects of the Lending Protocol. Unique to the Mainframe Lending Protocol is the liquidation mechanism, rehypothecation of collateral accounts, and an incentivization layer powered by staking the Mainframe Token (MFT).
