Description:
Elrond describes itself as a new blockchain architecture, designed to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two features: Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a reportedly fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can reportedly process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost. It aims to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.
