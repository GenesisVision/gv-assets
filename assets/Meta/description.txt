Description:
Meta lies at the heart of the mStable Standard. It is what ensures the integrity of mStable system in the event of permanent loss. mStable has a protocol token, Meta (MTA), with three core functions:
 to coordinate decentralised governance
; to incentivise bootstrapping of mASSET liquidity, utility and a decentralised community of Governors
; to act as the ultimate source of re-collateralisation when it is implemented. The Meta token aims to coordinate decentralised governance by incentivising stakeholders to act in the best interests of mStable.
