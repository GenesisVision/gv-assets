Description:
Bitcoin Cash ABC is a blockchain and cryptocurrency created on Nov. 15, 2020, as a result of a hard fork in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain that split the original chain into two new chains, provisionally called "Bitcoin Cash ABC" and "Bitcoin Cash Node." The latter retained the existing Bitcoin Cash name and ticker, while at the time of the fork, Bitcoin Cash ABC had not yet announced new branding. Bitcoin Cash ABC is based on the Bitcoin Cash protocol, which is itself a fork of the original Bitcoin (BTC) protocol. It is focused on providing a fast, highly scalable, global cryptocurrency in a manner that is sustainable in the long term.
