Description:
Bitcoin SV (BSV) started in November 2018 as a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, which itself was a hard forked version of the original Bitcoin. The Bitcoin SV team said that its vision is to restore the Bitcoin protocol to its original design, assuring stability with only a limited and well-known set of changes, including the restoration  the Satoshi op_codes to enable businesses and development teams around the world to create the many solutions possible on the BSV blockchain, such as smart contracts, tokenisation, atomic swaps, and many more.
