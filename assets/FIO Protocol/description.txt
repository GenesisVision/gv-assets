Description:
FIO Protocol (FIO) is a blockchain protocol that aims to enable a better way of sending/receiving coins and tokens. The FIO token is the native utility token of the project's blockchain infrastructure, FIO Chain, and is used for transaction gas fees and on-chain governance. The FIO Chain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) to achieve network consensus. Block Producers are elected by FIO token holders via on-chain voting. Anyone can register to become a BP and produce blocks if they receive enough votes.
