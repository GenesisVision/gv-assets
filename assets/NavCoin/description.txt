Description:
NavCoin (NAV) is a decentralised, open-source cryptocurrency launched in July 2014. It was rebranded several times - from Summercoin, which was a fork of Bitcoin, to Navajocoin, Navajo Coin, NAV Coin and finally NavCoin. After 100,000 proof-of-work blocks (using the X13 collection of hashing algorithms), the cryptocurrency has switched to a pure proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, with a diminishing rate of PoS interest that started at 20% and ended at 5% per annum starting from the third year on. The project's primary focus is on creating a cryptocurrency with enhanced privacy and anonymity of transactions.
