Description:
The Sandbox claims to be a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences in the Ethereum blockchain using SAND, the platformâ€™s utility token. It is claimed that players can create digital assets (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs), upload them to the marketplace, and drag-and-drop them to create game experiences with The Sandbox Game Maker. The Sandbox aims to bring blockchain into mainstream gaming, attracting both crypto and non-crypto game enthusiasts by offering the advantages of true-ownership, digital scarcity, monetization capabilities, and interoperability.
