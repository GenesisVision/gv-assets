Description:
Considered to be one of the improved blockchains that aim to solve the scalability problems of Bitcoin/Ethereum, EOS aims to serve as a host for dApps, smart contracts whilst reducing transaction costs for users to zero. This is achieved via itâ€™s consensus model, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), where users vote for a set of 21 block producers who generate and validate blocks on a much shorter time scale that the proof of work blockchains.
