Description:
Injective Protocol describes itself as the first layer-2 DEX that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. The Injective Chain is implemented as a Cosmos SDK module, built with Ethermint (EVM on Tendermint). It utilizes a Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake to facilitate cross chain derivatives trading across Cosmos, Ethereum, and many other layer-1 protocols. In addition, the protocol is collision resistant and utilizes Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) to prevent front-running.
