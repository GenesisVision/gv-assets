Name:
Golem

Symbol:
GLM

Description:
The Golem Network is a decentralized computation network, a new way of distributing redundant computing power to those who are in need of it, on-demand. It creates a peer-to-peer network where users join on an equal basis to buy and sell computation, splitting up complicated tasks into smaller subtasks in the network. In Golem thereâ€™s no central authority and no user is more or less important than another.
