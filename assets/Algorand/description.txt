Description:
Algorand is a permissionless, pure proof of stake blockchain that ensures full participation, protection and speed within a truly decentralized network. Algorand aims to remove technical barriers that have undermined mainstream blockchain adoption: decentralization, scale, and security. Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus protocol built on Byzantine agreement whereby the usersâ€™ influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to their stake in the system.
